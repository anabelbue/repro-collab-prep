**Fork**: A personal copy of a repository, saved under your own GitHub account. In typical collaborative writing projects, forking is usually *not* needed as collaborators usually work directly within the project repository (e.g., in their own branch). In this workshop, you are asked to fork the repository for technical reasons, so you can work on your own copy instead of editing the original workshop repository directly.

**Branch**: A parallel version of the project, created within the same repository. It allows collaborators to work on changes without affecting the main version of the project until their work is ready to be added. After finishing work in a branch, collaborators can open a pull request to suggest adding their changes to the main project. *Note*: Unlike forks, branches are always part of the shared repository and stay automatically up-to-date with the main version.

**Pull Request (PR)**: A way to suggest changes to a project. Pull requests can be made from a fork or from a branch within the same repository. They request that your changes are “pulled” into the main branch. A pull request lets others review your changes, give feedback, and approve them before they are added to the main branch.

**Issue**: A way to track tasks, ideas, or bugs within a specific repository. In collaborative writing, issues help structure work on the text (e.g., outlining sections), discuss revisions, or assign writing tasks.

**Practical tips for working with issues**: 

- *Create checklists*: Type `- [ ]` followed by a space and your task to track progress 
- *Mention people*: Type `@username` to notify someone directly
- *Reference issues or PRs*: Type `#issue-number` or `#PR-number` to link back to an existing issue or pull request
