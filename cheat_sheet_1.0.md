**Issue**: A way to track tasks, ideas, or bugs within a specific repository. In collaborative writing, issues help structure work on the text (e.g., outlining sections), discuss revisions, or assign writing tasks.

**Practical tips for working with issues**: 

- *Create checklists*: Type `- [ ]` followed by a space and your task to track progress 
- *Mention people*: Type `@username` to notify someone directly
- *Reference issues or pull requests*: Type `#issue-number` or `#pull-request-number` to link back to an existing issue or pull request
