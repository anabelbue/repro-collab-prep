**Fork**: a personal copy of a repository, saved under your own GitHub account. Forking allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. In typical collaborative writing projects, forking is usually *not* needed as collaborators are usually given direct editing permissions. In this workshop, you are asked to fork the repository for technical reasons, so you can work on your own copy instead of editing the original workshop repository directly.

**Pull Request (PR)**: A a way to suggest changes to a project. It lets others see what youâ€™ve changed, give feedback, and approve your suggestions before they are added to the main version of the project.

**Issue**: A way to track tasks, ideas, or bugs within a specific repository. In collaborative writing, issues help structure work on the text (e.g., outlining sections), discuss revisions, or assign writing tasks.

**Practical tips for working with issues**: 

- *Create checklists*: Type `- [ ]` followed by a space and your task to track progress 
- *Mention people*: Type `@username` to notify someone directly
- *Reference issues or PRs*: Type `#issue-number` or `#PR-number` to link back to an existing issue or pull request
