**Issue**  
A way to track tasks, ideas, or bugs within a **specific repository**. In collaborative writing, issues help structure work on the text (e.g., outlining sections), discuss revisions, or assign writing tasks.

### Practical tips

- **Create checklists**  
  Inside an issue or comment, type `- [ ]` followed by a space and your task. This creates a checkbox list to track progress. Example: 
- [ ] modfiy figure

- **Mention people**  
Type `@username` to notify someone directly. This is helpful when assigning tasks or asking for input.

- **Reference issues or pull requests**  
Type `#issue-number` or `#pull-request-number` to link back to an existing issue or pull request. This helps keep related discussions connected.
